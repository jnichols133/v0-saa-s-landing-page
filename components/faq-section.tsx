      question: "How quickly can I expect to see results?",
      answer:
        "For paid advertising (Meta Ads, Google Ads), you can start seeing results within the first 2-4 weeks as we optimise campaigns. SEO is a longer-term investment, typically showing significant results within 1-3 months. We provide regular reports so you can track progress from day one.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you require long-term contracts?",
      answer:
        "No, we don't believe in locking clients into long-term contracts. We work on a month-to-month basis because we're confident in our ability to deliver results. Our clients stay because they want to, not because they have to.",

      question: "What makes Jalex Media different from other agencies?",

    },
    {
      question: "How much do your services cost?",
      answer:
        "Our pricing varies based on your specific needs and goals. We offer customised packages to ensure you're only paying for what you need. Book a free strategy call and we'll provide a detailed quote based on your situation.",
    },
    {
